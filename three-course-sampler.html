        <p><strong>wood ear?</strong> you wrinkle your nose — the scrunched,
          black, translucent fungi splayed in front of you DO look vaguely like
          ears. blergh.</p>

        <p>as your inquiring eyes scan the plate, you see that splashes of color
          dot the dish. golden garlic chunks, bright red chili peppers, and
          green onions chopped into delicate o’s sprinkle the top of the
          mushrooms. with the wood ears glistening, the plate looks fresh and
          vibrant.</p>

        <p>using your fingertips, you waft the air toward you. a lively, citrusy
          aroma drifts into your nose and lingers for a moment, leaving a gentle
          spicy after-note.	you poke the mushrooms with your chopsticks. time to
          eat. cue deep breath. </p>

        <p>picking up your chopsticks, you dangle a wood ear into the air.</p>

            <p>a sour — no, vinegary — taste blooms on your tongue. a round,
              almost meaty flavor couples it, leaving your mouth watering for more.
              the wood ear mushrooms crunch gently under your teeth. you pause
              for a second. their firm, jelly-like texture is curious to you, and
              they’re slippery but chewy.</p>

            <p>as you eat more, the chili peppers begin to work their magic; a
              spirited spice starts to tap-dance in your mouth. you shove in mushy
              white rice to mellow out the flavor, adding more complex textures
              to your palate.</p>

            <p>gradually, you begin to notice an unfamiliar feeling. where you
              normally feel ridges at the roof of your mouth, the sensation is a
              little subdued. your tongue, tingling, senses something other than
              a burn. something kind of.... numb?</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>whatever. you wolf the rest down. it’s hot, zesty, and crunchy, and
          plainly irresistible. an apt way to describe this would be 色香味具全
          <em>sè xiāng wèi jùquán</em> — the smell, look, and taste of the dish
          unite to provide a hell of sensory experience.</p>

        <p>you might have heard of this cuisine: sichuan, szechwan, szechuan. it
          comes from (you might’ve guessed!) the sichuan basin, a province in the
          southern region of china. my mother hails from there, so its food is
          symbolic of home to me.</p>

        <p>that numb feeling you felt earlier? 四川 <em>sìchuān</em> cuisine is
          known for a taste called 麻辣 <em>málà</em> which translates to
          “numb-hot.” it’s from sichuan peppercorn 花椒 <em>huājiāo</em>, a spice
          that is integral to the cuisine. the wood ear dish often uses 花椒
          <em>huājiāo</em> oil.</p>
      </div>

          class='subtitles' id='peppercorn-subtitle'>
        <p> 花椒 <em>huājiāo</em> is quite literally a grenade of flavor.
          i mean, compare the two:</p>

        <div class='peppercorn-layout-container'>
          <div id='peppercorn-m2-imgs'>
            <img src='images/huajiao 2.svg' alt='image of red sichuan

              id='m2-img'>
          </div>

          <p id='peppercorn-grenade-text'>
            despite appearing like the black peppercorn that us americans all
            know and love,  花椒 <em>huājiāo</em> is part of the Citrus family.
            they are the husks of Zanthoxylum seeds— the red variety is from
            <em>Z. bungeanum</em> and the green is from <em>Z. armatum</em> or
            <em>Z. schinifolium</em>. in essence, these are all just different
            species of prickly ash plants.  the red has a rounder, woodier flavor
            whereas the green tastes sharper. if you accidentally chew on one,
            it will overwhelm your mouth with sourness and tingles. not the most
            pleasant experience.</p>

          <div id='sanshool-text'>
            <p>the molecule that produces the numbing sensation is
              hydroxy-alpha-sanshool, and it activates a tactile receptor that
              passes signals to the brain and creates a buzzing feeling on the
              lips and tongue. the numbness that 花椒 huājiāo brings to the table
              works well in tandem with spice.</p>

              <p>while it is not the spiciest of china’s four great cuisines,
                sichuan food is known for packing a punch, thanks to the red chili
                pepper. this ingredient is much less exotic than the sichuan
                peppercorn since it is used in cuisines worldwide. in sichuanese
                cooking, it’s either used dried or fresh.</p>

        <p><strong>you’re SO ready</strong> for round two. you grab your
          chopsticks.</p>

        <p>peering over the dish, you see a familiar sight: tofu. plump, petite
          cubes populate the wide-mouthed bowl, and they bathe in an
          orangey-brown sauce thickened with cornstarch. chunks of ground pork
          meat squish between the spaces, the surface of the dish once more
          garnished with green onion mini-rings.</p>

        <p>while the wood-ear smelled invigorating, the tofu possesses an
          earthier, cozier aroma. streams of steam noodle into the air, and then
          dissipate; the dish makes you feel at home, even though you haven’t
          even tasted it yet!</p>

        <div class='entree-layout-container'>
          <img src='images/mapotofu.svg' alt='real-life picture of mapo tofu'

          <div id='three-entree-pghs'>
            <p>you scoop a generous portion of tofu into your rice bowl. as you
              place a cube in your mouth, it melts on your tongue and you can
              swallow without chewing; the silken tofu used for this dish is so
              pillowy it breaks upon contact with the roof of your mouth.</p>

            <p>though there are no chili peppers present, it is still slightly
              spicy, and you taste the familiar numbness of 花椒 <em>huājiāo</em>,
              this time in the form of powder. </p>

            <p>apparently, 麻婆豆腐 <em>mápó dòufu</em> got its name from the
              cratered (“pock-marked”) face of the old lady who invented the dish.
              oil porters who passed by her water-side eatery were so crazy for
              her tofu that her restaurant became one of the most famous
              restaurants in late-qing dynasty (1664 - 1911) chengdu, a city in
              sichuan.</p>

        </div>

        <p>well, no wonder. the best part of this dish, you decide, is the savory
          umami of the sauce. it goes especially well with rice and you finish
          the dish within minutes.</p>

          <p>the ingredient that gives the sauce such a unique flavor is 郫县豆瓣
            <em>píxiàn dòubàn</em>, which is fermented fava bean and chili paste.
            while not obvious on the surface — sichuan peppercorns and chili
            peppers often hog the spotlight—  郫县豆瓣 <em>píxiàn dòubàn</em> is
            the heart of sichuanese food, as it provides dishes with a
            multi-dimensional base.</p>

          <p>豆瓣 <em>dòubàn</em> just means “bean paste” and 郫县 <em>píxiàn</em>
            refers to a sichuanese city. for it to be 地道 <em>dìdào</em>
            (authentic) sichuanese cooking, you MUST use 郫县 <em>píxiàn</em>
            bean paste. my mother affirms this emphatically. the production
            methods in 郫县 <em>píxiàn</em> are a time-honored tradition. in fact,
            there is a special 豆瓣 <em>dòubàn</em> society there where
            paste-making factories must abide by rigorous production standards to
            remain part of it.</p>

          <p>take this excerpt from a sichuanese food blog, which explains how
            豆瓣 <em>dòubàn</em> is made:</p>
        </div>

        <div id='douban-blog-post'>
          <div id='blog-text'>
            <p> <em> “First, fava beans, or broad beans, are fermented until they
              grow greenish powdery mold. Originally this was done naturally,
              taking advantage of natural occurring bacterias in the damp region,
              or by laying them on grain husks that encouraged their development.
              In some cases flour, [sic] would be added to further the
              development.</em>
            </p>

            <p><em>After molding, the beans would be washed in baijiu (yep another
              win for baijiu!) [white wine] then mixed with fresh minced chilis
              and A LOT of salt. Originally these were all mixed together in
              giant earthenware pots. The lids would be removed in the day,
              to allow the paste to dry and heat up in the sunshine, then
              covered up at night and mixed every morning. Typically the whole
              mix needs around a month to ferment enough to be considered douban,
              but any high quality sauce is fermented for at least a year. Many
              are fermented for longer, and 3 and 8 yeardoubans [sic] are not
              uncommon....”</em>

        <p><strong>you’re honestly too full</strong> at this point, but you

          rice soaked in filmy, watery liquid. there are also opaque white orbs
          floating on the surface. it doesn’t look too appetizing, but the
          wood-ear mushrooms taught you that it’s the inside that counts!
          you inhale the sweet fragrance of the soup as you lift up the spoon to
          your mouth to take a sip.</p>

        <p>whoa. just as sweet as it smells. and slightly boozy. kind of like a
          nice cognac, and it neutralizes the spiciness and numbness of the
          previous dishes. you close your eyes, letting the soup’s warmth radiate
          to the rest of your body.</p>

            <p>unlike that of regular rice, the grains in the 醪糟 <em>láozāo</em>

              against the roof of your mouth and find that you can easily make
              a little ball. you then pick out one of those mysterious orbs and
              bite into it. </p>

            <p>delighted to discover that it’s mochi-like and gummy and it sticks
              to your teeth slightly, you declare the glutinous rice balls,
              called 汤圆 <em>tāngyuán</em>, your favorite part. </p>

            <p>while 醪糟 <em>láozāo</em> did not necessarily come from sichuan,
              it is popular there. in general, it is popular all over china and
              is also called 酒酿 <em>jiǔniàng</em>. if left to ferment for
              longer and at a higher temperature, the rice could produce
              rice wine. 醪糟 <em>láozāo</em> does have about 2 percent alcohol
              concentration though — lightweights, beware!</p>
