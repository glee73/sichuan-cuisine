# sichuan cuisine: a three course sampler

### Introduction

Make sure you have a full stomach before you read my project because it will
make you hungry! I wrote this creative non-fiction piece on Sichuanese cuisine
for an English class. I was inspired by a book we read that was written in a
very non-traditional format, so I tried combining my interests of writing
and coding into one. This was a super fun project, and I love how it turned out
as well as how much I learned from it.

### Technologies

HTML5, CSS3

### Instructions for use
If you'd like to play around, this is the link to my Figma prototype -

### Bugs/shortcomings

This was my first time creating a website, and from scratch, so I made the
mistake of designing for desktop first, and not mobile. While putting everything
on Figma, I did not consider how I could more easily make my design responsive.
That is something I will consider next time, like when I make my personal
website. At this point, I hadn't learned Javascript yet either. Currently
in the process - will learn React as well and come back to improve this project.
